# Forest Guardian

A community-powered mobile app connecting local residents with forest rangers to protect our natural resources.

## Problem Statement

Our forests face several critical challenges:

- Illegal poaching and logging destroying habitats
- Wildlife intrusion into residential areas
- Communication gaps between local residents and forest rangers
- Difficulties in contacting forest officials during emergencies
- Lack of funding for conservation efforts

## Our Solution

Forest Guardian bridges the gap between communities and forest departments. The app enables easy reporting of forest-related incidents, quick communication with rangers, and community engagement for conservation efforts.

## Approach

We built Forest Guardian with a community-first mindset. By making it simple for people living near forests to report issues and connect with authorities, we create a powerful network of forest protectors. The app uses location services, image uploads, and direct messaging to ensure fast response to threats.
